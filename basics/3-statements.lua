-- Statements:
-- Lua needs no separator between consecutive statements, but we can use a semicolon if we wish. Line breaks play no role in Lua's syntax; for instance, the following four chunks are all valid and equivalent:
a= 1 b=a* 2
a = 1;
b = a * 2;
a = 1; b = a * 2
a = 1  b = a * 2 -- ugly, but valid
